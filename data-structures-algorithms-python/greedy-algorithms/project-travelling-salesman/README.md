### Codecademy Traveling Salesman Project

To be honest, this was a poorly thought out project from Codecademy - they're usually much better than this.

The tasks and the script they want you to write does not give a complete solution to the traveling salesman problem - it only covers part of it.
The test case they give you is also too basic, and even this one comes back with erratic results (try running it several times and see.)

The improvements I made are as follows.
