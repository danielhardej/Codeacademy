#### Recursion is typically more efficient than iteration.

- [ ] True.
- [x] False.

#### A recursive function which has no base case, or a recursive step that does not lead to the base case, will cause what?

- [ ] A queue underflow.
- [x] A stack overflow.
- [ ] A queue overflow.
- [ ] A stack underflow.

#### A function will not recurse if the ____ is reached.

- [ ] Recursive step.
- [ ] Divide step.
- [ ] Best case.
- [x] Base case.

#### What is an execution context and how does it relate to recursion?

- [ ] An execution context contains the function definition without additional arguments to recursive function calls.
- [ ] An execution context contains the total amount of recursive function calls.
- [ ] An execution context contains the iterations within the initial function call.
- [x] An execution context contains the variables within each recursive function call.

#### What are the two main sections of a recursive function?

- [ ] The base case and the repeating step.
- [ ] The base case and the basest case.
- [ ] The recursive step and the termination phase.
- [x] The base case and the recursive step.

#### What is the importance of the recursive step?

- [x] It recursively calls the function with an argument which will reach the base case.
- [ ] It retrieves a return value.
- [ ] It prevents a stack overflow.
- [ ] It removes one element from a list.

#### What is the purpose of the base case in a recursive function?

- [ ] In the base case, the function recurses one step closer to terminating.
- [x] In the base case, there is no recursive function call.
- [ ] In the base case, the function switches from base 10 to base 2.
- [ ] In the base case, the function’s values are returned.

#### What is the call stack?

A data structure typically abstracted away from us which retrieves recursive calls from the computer’s RAM.
A data structure typically abstracted away from us which is unnecessary when using iteration.
- [x] A data structure typically abstracted away from us which stores function calls in programs.
A data structure typically abstracted away from us which stores additional memory when necessary.

#### Which of the following describes a recursive approach?

To print the spelling of a name, use a for loop with an index variable to access each letter.
To compute a factorial number, declare a result variable and loop through each number from 1 to the input number, storing the product of that number with result.
To iterate through a list, create a counting variable which is incremented through the length of the list.
- [x] To compute a factorial number, multiply the number by the factorial number minus one.

#### When analyzing the Big O runtime of recursive functions, we count the ____.

Relation of input to loop iterations.
Relationship of input to base cases.
- [x] Relation of input to function calls.
Relationship of input to stack overflows.
