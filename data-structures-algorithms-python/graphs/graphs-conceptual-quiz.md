#### How is a graph represented in an adjacency list?

- [ ] As one single path.
- [ ] Only the edges of the graph are present.
- [ ] Each edge contains a list of the vertices where another vertex exists.
- [x] Each vertex contains a list of the vertices where an edge exists between them.

#### How is a graph represented in an adjacency matrix?

- [x] As a table with vertices as the rows and the columns. The cells of the spreadsheet mark whether an edge exists.
- [ ] As a running tally of vertices and edges. 1 is added each time a new vertex or edge is added to the graph.
- [ ] As a table with edges as the rows and the columns. The cells of the spreadsheet mark whether a vertex exists.

#### What does it mean for two vertices, or nodes, to be adjacent?

- [x] The vertices are directly connected by an edge.
- [ ] The vertices have the same data type.
- [ ] The vertices have a bi-directional edge between them.
- [ ] The vertices have an edge with a low cost.

#### In a weighted graph, edges have a _____ associated with them.

- [ ] Primary Vertex.
- [ ] Smell.
- [x] Cost.
- [ ] Warning.

#### What is the node in a graph called?

- [ ] A Data Point.
- [ ] A Link.
- [ ] A Root.
- [x] A Vertex.

#### A connection between two vertices is called what?

- [ ] A Bridge.
- [ ] A Trail.
- [ ] A Road.
- [x] An Edge.

#### What is a cycle?

- [ ] A directed graph where only one edge is bi-directional.
- [ ] A weighted graph where every edge has the same cost.
- [ ] One or more vertices connected to one or more edges.
- [x] A path which begins and ends at the same vertex.

#### What is a path?

- [ ] A clustering of vertices that all contain the same data.
- [x] A sequence of edges connecting a sequence of vertices.
- [ ] The overall structure of the graph.
- [ ] The optimal route for moving through the graph.

#### In a directed graph, you can always move between two vertices as long as an edge exists between them.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

#### In an undirected graph, an edge connecting two vertices is bi-directional.

- [ ] False.
- [x] True.
