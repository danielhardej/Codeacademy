# In this lesson, we will learn how neural networks can be applied to image classification.
# To do this, we will be using convolutional layers: layers designed to process image data by
# focusing on local relationships between features.

# Pneumonia, the infection of lung tissue, is responsible for over two and a half million deaths
# worldwide. A radiologistâ€™s diagnosis is often critical for the discovery and treatment of pneumonia.
# However, these doctors are often in short supply.

# In this lesson, we will train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically
# classify chest X-rays, showcasing the potential for deep learning in medical domains.
