# Random Forests Project
### [BETA] INTERMEDIATE MACHINE LEARNING

In this project, we will be using a dataset containing census information from UCIâ€™s Machine Learning Repository.

By using this census data with a random forest, we will try to predict whether or not a person makes more than $50,000.

The original data set is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
