# Software Engineering for Machine Learning/AI Engineers

In this module, we covered the following topics:

- Software engineering in Python
- The command line
- Git & version control
- Bash scripting
- Git for deployment

Note that a lot of the material in Software Engineering in Python I and Software Engineering in Python II was already covered in the Advanced Python course.
