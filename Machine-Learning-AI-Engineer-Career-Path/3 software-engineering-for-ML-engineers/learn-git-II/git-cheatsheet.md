# Git & GitHub Cheatsheet

## The Git Workflow

#### The workflow for Git collaborations typically follows this order:

1. Fetch and merge changes from the remote
2. Create a branch to work on a new project feature
3. Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work
4. Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working)
5. Push your branch up to the remote for review

#### What is the Git remote?
A remote is a Git repository that lives outside your Git project folder. Remotes can live on the web, on a shared network or even in a separate folder on your local computer.

The Git Collaborative Workflow are steps that enable smooth project development when multiple collaborators are working on the same Git project.
