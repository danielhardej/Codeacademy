#### In the image below, the circle with the solid line represents the true label of points. Points that fall in the circle have the label 1 and points outside the circle have the label 0. The circle with the dotted line represents the classification’s guess — if the point is inside the dotted circle, it has been classified as a 1, otherwise, it is classified as a 0. What is the equation for recall?
