# Binning data is the process of taking numerical or categorical data and breaking
# it up into groups. We could decide to bin our data to help capture patterns in
# noisy data. There isnâ€™t a clean and fast rule about how to bin your data, but
# like so many things in machine learning, you need to be aware of the trade-offs.
