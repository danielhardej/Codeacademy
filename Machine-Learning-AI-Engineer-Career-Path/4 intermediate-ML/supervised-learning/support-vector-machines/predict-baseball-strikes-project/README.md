## Project: Predict Baseball Strike Zones With Machine Learning

In this project, we will use an SVM trained using a baseball dataset to find the decision boundary of the strike zone.

A batter standing in front of the plate with the strike zone outlined.
The strike zone can be thought of as a decision boundary that determines whether or not a pitch is a strike or a ball. There is a strict definition of the strike zone: however, in practice, it will vary depending on the umpire or the player at bat.

Let’s use our knowledge of SVMs to find the real strike zone of several baseball players.

We used the pybaseball Python package to get the data for this project. If you’re interested in getting more data, the documentation for pybaseball can help you get data that you’re interested in onto your own computer.
