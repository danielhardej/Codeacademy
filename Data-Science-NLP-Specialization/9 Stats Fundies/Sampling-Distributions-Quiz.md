#### Which of the following is NOT part of the process for simulating the sampling distribution of a particular statistic?


Calculate the statistic for each sample.


 - [x] Take many random samples from a population, each of a different size.


Take many random samples from a population, each of the same size.


Plot the distribution of the sample statistics.

#### Hummingbirds have a mean wingspan of 4.25 inches with a standard deviation of 0.25 inches. For a sample size of 100 hummingbird wingspans, what are the mean and standard deviation (standard error) of the sampling distribution of the mean?

$$
mean = 4.25\\
std\ error = \frac{0.25}{\sqrt{100}}
$$

_With many random samples of large sample size, the Central Limit Theorem states that the mean of the sampling distribution of the mean will be equal to the population mean, and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean will be equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size._


#### Fill in the text below to correctly identify whether the following sample statistics are biased or unbiased estimators of the corresponding population statistic.

```
Mean: Unbiased Estimator
Maximum: Biased Estimator
```

#### Suppose that the average height of an adult is 67 inches, with a standard deviation of 3 inches. Fill in the code below to correctly answer the following question: What is the probability that a randomly sampled group of 10 adults has an average height that is less than or equal to 65 inches?

```
stats.norm.cdf(65, 67, 3/(10**.5))
```

#### At a certain school, the average student gpa is 3.3. The standard deviation is 0.5, and the distribution is heavily skewed to the left.  For a sample size of 300 students, what would we expect the shape of the sampling distribution of the mean to look like?

Skewed Left
Skewed Right
Not enough information to know
 - [x] Normal


_Since our sample size is relatively large, the Central Limit Theorem states that our sampling distribution should be approximately normally distributed._

#### For the sampling distribution of the mean: if we increase sample size from n = 30 to n = 60, what happens to the mean and standard deviation (standard error) of the sampling distribution?

Mean: stays the same Standard Error: stays the same
Mean: increases Standard Error: decreases
 - [x] Mean: stays the same Standard Error: decreases
Mean: stays the same Standard Error: increases

#### If we collect a sample of data from a population and calculate a statistic for our observed sample, we will know the exact value of that statistic for the larger population.

- [x] False
- [ ] True
