# Principles of Data Literacy: Introduction to Data
## Analyzing Data Quiz

#### The 5 main types of data analysis are:

- [ ] Explanatory, Exploratory, Inferential, Causal, Predictive
- [ ] Descriptive, Exploratory, Inferential, Causal, Magic-Ball
- [ ] Summative, Exploratory, Deductive, Effective, Predictive
- [x] Descriptive, Exploratory, Inferential, Causal, Predictive

#### Fill in the blanks:

    Descriptive analyses describe major patterns in data through summary statistics and visualization of measures of central tendency and spread.

#### True or False? If you choose a good algorithm, you donâ€™t need to worry about the quality of the data used to create your predictive model.

- [ ] True
- [x] False


#### Fill in the blanks to complete the statements about predictive analyses.

    Predictive analyses allow us to make data-driven predictions about the future. Predictive analyses often use supervised machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes.

#### Which of the following is NOT a major goal of analyzing data?

- [ ] To mathematically summarize large datasets.
- [x] To know the future with absolute certainty.
- [ ] To find and evaluate patterns in data.
- [ ] To discover useful information and support decision-making.

#### In an exploratory analysis of weather station data, you plotted the temperature at 9 am each day against the daily maximum temperature and found that there was a strong linear relationship between morning temperature and the daily max: as morning temperature increased, so did the maximum temperature reached that day. As a result, you can say:

- [ ] The morning temperature is not correlated with the maximum temperature.
- [ ] High morning temperatures cause high daily maximum temperatures.
- [ ] High morning temperatures cause low daily maximum temperatures.
- [x] The morning temperature is correlated with the maximum temperature.

#### True or false? Conclusions drawn from a descriptive analysis with one dataset can be extended to other datasets.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

#### Fill in the blanks to complete the sentence about inferential analysis.

    Inferential analysis lets us draw conclusions about a population based on results from a sample.

#### If you want to run an AB test for a feature on a website that receives 100,000 visitors per day from the U.S.A, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and South Africa, which of the following would be an appropriate sample?

- [x] Every 10th site visitor from each country until you have sampled 10,000 visitors.
- [ ] The first 10,000 people that visit the site.
- [ ] 10,000 of the people that visit your site the most frequently.
- [ ] 10,000 randomly selected visitors from the U.S.A.

#### We can go beyond correlation and assign causation with causal analysis:

- [x] When we do a carefully designed experiment or if we use advanced techniques with observational data that meet strict assumptions.
- [ ] Never. It is not possible to determine causation.
- [ ] Only when we are working with observational data that meet strict assumptions.
- [ ] Only when we do a carefully designed experiment.
