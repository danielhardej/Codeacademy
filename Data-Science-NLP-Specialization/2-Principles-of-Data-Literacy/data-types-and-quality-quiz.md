# Principles of Data Literacy: Introduction to Data
## Data Types and Quality Quiz

#### What types of problems can messy data create?

    inconsistent coding can result in splitting categories, missing data can contribute to inaccurate summaries, and typos can make grouping similar terms difficult.

#### True or False: Because it is a subset of the population, a random sample will always perfectly represent the population.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

#### Given the description of the dataset, determine the type of each categorical variable.

    Variable	Description
    ID	Student ID
    Name	Name of the person
    Age	Numerical value for each student’s age
    Letter_Grade	Categorical value for the student’s grade (A, B, C, D or F)
    Class_Subject	Subject of class (Math, Chemistry, History, etc.)

- [x] Letter_Grade is an ordinal variable and Class_Subject is a nominal variable.


#### Which of these issues would compromise the accuracy of a dataset?

- [x] Some researchers measured distances in meters and others measured in yards and records the values without units.
- [ ] A researcher measures the weight of some inanimate objects in the morning and other inanimate objects in the evening.
- [ ] Some measurements are made mechanically and some are made digitally.
- [ ] Some researchers use iPads to record the data and others use pencil and paper before inputting the values into the system.

#### What questions should you ask yourself to ensure data validity?

    Does this variable measure what I think it does?
    Do I have  data that aligns to my question?

#### What are the two types of categorical variables?

    Categorical variables can be either ordinal (ordered) or nominal (unordered).


#### True or False? You should always fill in missing numeric variables with the mean of the column

- [x] False
- [ ] True

#### Which one of these is NOT a categorical variable?

- [ ] Country of birth: Italy, Mexico, United States, Thailand, Spain
- [ ] Survey responses: Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Somewhat Disagree, Somewhat Agree, Agree, Strongly Agree
- [x] Blood pressure measured daily: 110/90, 120/92, 115/86, 120/90
- [ ] Student grades: A, B, C, D, E
