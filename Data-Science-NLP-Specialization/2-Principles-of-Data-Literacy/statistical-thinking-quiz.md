## Statistical Thinking Quiz

#### Fill in the blanks to make the following statements true.

    Extreme values that are distant from the rest of the distribution are called outliers. These extreme values may heavily influence the mean more than the median. A measure that is not as heavily influenced by outliers and skewness is called a robust statistic.

#### You are creating a report on annual car sales from a dataset that contains information on every car sold at your dealership this year. One of the variables is the color of the car, which includes categories like “gray”, “white”, “red”, and “blue”. To describe the variable for color, you want to make a table of measurements. What kind of measurements could go in your table for this kind of variable?

- [ ] The mean and standard deviation for the color variable.
- [x] The frequency and proportion of each color in the dataset.
- [ ] The median and interquartile range of the color variable.

#### True or False: Finding the mean number of cities for every region of a country is an example of aggregating data.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

#### You are reading an article about retirement ages. The article reports that the median retirement age is 65.4 years old with an interquartile range of 7.2 years. Which of the following statements about the distribution of retirement ages is true?

- [ ] The second quartile is greater than 65.4.
- [ ] The third quartile is 72.6 years.
- [ ] The first quartile is 58.2 years.
- [x] Half of the ages in the distribution are less than 65.4 and the other half are greater than 65.4. The middle 50% of the data spans 7.2 years.

#### Fill in the blanks to make the statements true.

    You want to explore the relationship between two numeric variables: age and height. To visually check the relationship, it would be best to make a scatter plot of the variables. To get a numeric summary of the linear relationship between the variables, you should also get their correlation coefficient.

#### Fill in the blanks to make the statement about a correlation coefficient true.

    A correlation coefficient of -0.97 tells us about the linear relationship between two numeric variables.

    The negative sign indicates that low values of the first variable are associated with high values of the second, and high values of the first variable are associated with low values of the second.

    The distance of the coefficient from zero tells us the strength of the relationship, which is strong because -0.97 is very close to -1.

#### Fill in the blanks to make the statements about the plot true.

- [ ] This plot shows the distribution of the numeric variable x, which gives the possible values of a variable and their frequencies.

#### Which of the following is true about the distribution shown?

- [ ] There is no change in frequency across this distribution.
- [x] The distribution may be considered skewed because it is asymmetrical with a longer tail on the left side.
- [ ] This distribution may be considered normal because it is symmetrical and bell-shaped.

#### You are reading about a survey on time spent cleaning different areas of the home. Participants were asked how many hours per week they spent cleaning each room of their home. The mean and standard deviation times in hours are shown in the table. Which statement about the distributions of cleaning times is true?

- [ ] The average distance from the center for values in the bathroom’s distribution is 1.2 hours.
- [ ] The distributions for the living room and dining room have the same spread, but the distribution for the living room has a higher center value.
- [x] The distributions for the living room and dining room have the same center value, but the distribution for the living room has a wider spread.
- [ ] The center of the distribution for the kitchen is 1.9 hours.

#### True or False: We can always get precise summary information about the variables in a dataset just by viewing them in the dataframe.

- [x] False
- [ ] True
